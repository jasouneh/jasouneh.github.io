    <p>The <strong> <a href="https://fitnessgram.net/pacertest/" title="FitnessGram Pacer Test"> FitnessGram</a> </strong> PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that
        progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
        The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the

          each lap signaled by a beep sound. The test get progressively faster as it
          continues until the student reaches their max lap score.</p>
